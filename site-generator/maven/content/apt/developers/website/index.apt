Introduction

 The Maven {{{https://maven.apache.org}https://maven.apache.org}} website is composed from:

 * a main content,

 * multiple components reference documentation, published for each component release.

 []

 And {{{https://maven.apache.org/doxia/}Doxia}} website has the same dual structure.

 These contents are stored in svn and svnpubsub/svnwcsub maintains a working copy on the webservers in <<</www/maven.apache.org/content>>>,
 see {{{https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-puppet/blob/deployment/modules/svnwcsub/files/svnwcsub.conf#L152}<<<svnwcsub>>> configured in infra Puppet}}:

 * <<</>>> comes from {{{https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/website/content/}https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/website/content/}}

 * {{{https://maven.apache.org/components}<<</components>>>}} comes from {{https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/website/components/}}

 * <<</doxia>>> comes from {{{https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/doxia/website/content/}https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/doxia/website/content/}}

 * {{{https://maven.apache.org/doxia/components}<<</doxia/components>>>}} comes from {{https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/doxia/website/components/}}

 []

 and the link between main content and components reference documentation is done with symbolic links.

How website publication works

 Instructions on how to publish website content are split in separate documents:

 * main content is published through Jenkins jobs:
   {{{https://builds.apache.org/job/maven-box/job/maven-site/}maven-site}}
   and {{{https://builds.apache.org/job/maven-box/job/maven-doxia-site/}doxia-site}},

 * {{{./deploy-component-reference-documentation.html}deploying Maven components reference documentation}},
 eventually using {{{./component-reference-documentation-helper.html}Component Reference Documentation Helper}} to
 easily prepare <<<svnmucc>>> command line.
